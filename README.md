Noughts Coding Test
===================

The task is to implement the server side of a multiplayer
[noughts and crosses or tic-tac-toe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game.  We've provided a skeleton
Dropwizard app that defines the API but lacks an implementation.  You will need to provide an implementation.

Rules
-----

Two players take turns to place a mark in one of the spaces on a 3x3 grid.  Each player cannot place a mark where either
player has placed one previously.  The first player who places three consecutive marks in a horizontal, vertical or
diagonal row wins the game.  If all of the spaces are taken and no player has succeeded in placing 3 marks in a row
then the game is a draw.

API
---

Please ensure that your application meets this API.  The NoughtsResource and NoughtsTest classes provided should make it
clear how to achieve this.  Please return appropriate http error codes to enforce both the rules described above and
the restrictions described below.

### Create a game ###

    method                : POST
    url                   : /game?player1Id=<id of player 1>&player2Id=<id of player 2>
    example response body : "<id of the new game>"

The client will provide the ids of the players. Players can create games against multiple different players concurrently
but an appropriate error code should be returned if a player tries to create a  new game against a player that they
currently have an unfinished game against.  The response should be a json string containing an id that identifies the
new game.

### Make a move ###

    method                : PUT
    url                   : /game/<id of the game>
    example request body  : {"playerId": "<id of player making the move>", "x": <column index to make a mark in>, , "y": <row index to make a mark in>}
    example response body : <empty>

The <id of the game> will be the id of a game previously created via a call the *Create a game* endpoint.  The player id
will be the id of the player making the move.  An error code should be returned if a player makes a move out of turn.
Assume that player 1 will always go first.

### Get the game state ###

    method                                   : GET
    url                                      : /game/<id of the game>
    example response body (game in progress) : {"winnerId": null, "gameOver": false}
    example response body (win)              : {"winnerId": "<id of the winning player>", "gameOver": true}
    example response body (draw)             : {"winnerId": null, "gameOver": true}

The <id of the game> will be the id of a game previously created via a call the *Create a game* endpoint.  If the game
is still in progress the winnerId should be null and gameOver should be false.  If a player has won then then the
winnerId should be the the id of that player and gameOver should be true. If the game is complete and a draw then the
winnerId should be null and gameOver should be true.


Bonus Tasks
-----------

For bonus points:

### Extend the tests ###

Extend the NoughtsTest class to cover more of the rules and restrictions described above.

### Concurrency handling ###

Ensure that your application runs efficiently and without error despite serving multiple players playing concurrently.
Assume that players will try and break the game by making concurrent requests against the same player.

### Persistence ###

Store the state of the games in an external data store of your choice.  Aim to handle 1000s of concurrent games on a
modern mid-range laptop.

### Leaderboard ###

Add a leaderboard to the game, allowing clients to get the top 10 player ids and scores. Players should get 1 point per
game won and no points for draws.
